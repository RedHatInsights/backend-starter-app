# CHANGELOG

## 0.29.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.0.1, 3.1.1 and 3.2.0
* Increase the size of the `/tmp` volumes to 5Mi to allow unpacking of compression libraries
* Use `/healthz` endpoint for Kafka Exporter health checks
* Renew user certificates in User Operator only during maintenance windows
* Ensure Topic Operator using Kafka Streams state store can start up successfully 
* Update Cruise Control to 2.5.89
* Remove TLS sidecar from Cruise Control pod. Cruise Control is now configured to not using ZooKeeper, so the TLS sidecar is not needed anymore.
* Allow Cruise Control topic names to be configured
* Add support for `spec.rack.topologyKey` property in Mirror Maker 2 to enable "fetch from the closest replica" feature.
* Support for the s390x platform
  _(The s390x support is currently considered as experimental. We are not aware of any issues, but the s390x build doesn't at this point undergo the same level of testing as the AMD64 container images.)_
* Update Strimzi Kafka Bridge to 0.21.5
* Added rebalancing modes on the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource
  * `full`: this mode runs a full rebalance moving replicas across all the brokers in the cluster. This is the default one if not specified.
  * `add-brokers`: after scaling up the cluster, this mode is used to move replicas to the newly added brokers specified in the custom resource.
  * `remove-brokers`: this mode is used to move replicas off the brokers that are going to be removed, before scaling down the cluster.
* **Experimental** KRaft mode (ZooKeeper-less Kafka) which can be enabled using the `UseKRaft` feature gate.
  **Important: Use it for development and testing only!**

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Since the Cruise Control TLS sidecar has been removed, the related configuration options `.spec.cruiseControl.tlsSidecar` and `.spec.cruiseControl.template.tlsSidecar` in the Kafka custom resource are now deprecated.

## 0.28.0

* Add support for Kafka 3.1.0; remove Kafka 2.8.0 and 2.8.1
* Add support for `StrimziPodSet` resources (disabled by default through the `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate)
* Update Open Policy Agent authorizer to 1.4.0 and add support for enabling metrics
* Support custom authentication mechanisms in Kafka listeners
* Intra-broker disk balancing using Cruise Control
* Add connector context to the default logging configuration in Kafka Connect and Kafka Mirror Maker 2
* Added the option `createBootstrapService` in the Kafka Spec to disable the creation of the bootstrap service for the Load Balancer Type Listener. It will save the cost of one load balancer resource, specially in the public cloud.
* Added the `connectTimeoutSeconds` and `readTimeoutSeconds` options to OAuth authentication configuration. The default connect and read timeouts are set to 60 seconds (previously there was no timeout). Also added `groupsClaim` and `groupsClaimDelimiter` options in the listener configuration of Kafka Spec to allow extracting group information from JWT token at authentication time, and making it available to the custom authorizer. These features are enabled by the updated Strimzi Kafka OAuth library (0.10.0).
* Add support for disabling the FIPS mode in OpenJDK
* Fix renewing your own CA certificates [#5466](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/5466)
* Update Strimzi Kafka Bridge to 0.21.4
* Update Cruise Control to 2.5.82

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The Strimzi Identity Replication Policy (class `io.strimzi.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy`) is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  Please update to Kafka's own Identity Replication Policy (class `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy`).
* The `type` field in `ListenerStatus` has been deprecated and will be removed in the future.
* The `disk` and `cpuUtilization` fields in the `spec.cruiseControl.capacity` section of the Kafka resource have been deprecated, are ignored, and will be removed in the future.

## 0.27.0

* Multi-arch container images with support for x86_64 / AMD64 and AArch64 / ARM64 platforms
  _(The support AArch64 is currently considered as experimental. We are not aware of any issues, but the AArch64 build doesn't at this point undergo the same level of testing as the AMD64 container images.)_
* Added the option to configure the Cluster Operator's Zookeeper admin client session timeout via an new env var: `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`
* The `ControlPlaneListener` and `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gates are now in the _beta_ phase and are enabled by default.
* Allow setting any extra environment variables for the Cluster Operator container through Helm using a new `extraEnvs` value.
* Added SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for Kafka clients
* Update OPA Authorizer to 1.3.0
* Update to Cruise Control version 2.5.79
* Update Log4j2 to 2.17.0

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate is now enabled by default.
  When upgrading from Strimzi 0.22 or earlier, you have to disable the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate when upgrading the cluster operator to make sure the Kafka cluster stays available during the upgrade.
  When downgrading to Strimzi 0.22 or earlier, you have to disable the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate before downgrading the cluster operator to make sure the Kafka cluster stays available during the downgrade.

## 0.26.0

* Add support for Kafka 2.8.1 and 3.0.0; remove Kafka 2.7.0 and 2.7.1
* Update the Open Policy Agent Authorizer to version [1.1.0](https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

* Enable Cruise Control anomaly.detection configurations
* Add support for building connector images from the Maven coordinates
* Allow Kafka Connect Build artifacts to be downloaded from insecure servers (#5542)
* Add option to specify pull secret in Kafka Connect Build on OpenShift (#5631)
* Configurable authentication, authorization, and SSL for Cruise Control API
* Update to Cruise Control version 2.5.73
* Allow to configure `/tmp` volume size via Pod template. By default `1Mi` is used.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* imageRepositoryOverride,imageRegistryOverride and imageTagOverride are now removed from values.yaml. defaultImageRepository, defaultImageRegistry and defaultImageTag values are introduced in helm charts which sets the default registry, repository and tags for the images. Now the registry, repository and tag for a single image can be configured as per the requirement.
* The OpenShift Templates were removed from the examples and are no longer supported (#5548)
* Kafka MirrorMaker 1 has been deprecated in Apache Kafka 3.0.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0.0.
  As a result, the `KafkaMirrorMaker` custom resource which is used to deploy Kafka MirrorMaker 1 has been deprecated in Strimzi as well. (#5617)
  The `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource will be removed from Strimzi when we adopt Apache Kafka 4.0.0.
  As a replacement, use the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource with the [`IdentityReplicationPolicy`](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html#unidirectional_replication_activepassive).

## 0.25.0

* Move from Scala 2.12 to Scala 2.13. (#5192)
* Open Policy Agent authorizer updated to a new version supporting Scala 2.13. See the _Changes, deprecations and removals_ sections for more details. (#5192)

* Update User Operator to use Admin API for managing SCRAM-SHA-512 users
* Configure fixed size limit for `emptyDir` volumes used for temporary files (#5340)
* Update Strimzi Kafka Bridge to 0.20.2

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `KafkaConnectS2I` resource has been removed and is no longer supported by the operator.
  Please use the [migration guide](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/0.24.0/full/using.html#proc-migrating-kafka-connect-s2i-str) to migrate your `KafkaConnectS2I` deployments to [`KafkaConnect` Build](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* The Open Policy Agent authorizer has been updated to a new version that supports Scala 2.13.
  The new release introduces a new format of the input data sent to the Open Policy Agent server.
  For more information about the new format and how to migrate from the old version, see the [OPA Kafka plugin v1.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
* User Operator now uses Kafka Admin API to manage SCRAM-SHA-512 credentials.
  All operations done by the User Operator now use Kafka Admin API and connect directly to Kafka instead of ZooKeeper.
  As a result, the environment variables `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT` and `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` were removed from the User Operator configuration.
* All `emptyDir` volumes used by Strimzi for temporary files have now configured a fixed size limit.

* Use Red Hat UBI8 base image
* Add support for Kafka 2.7.1 and remove support for 2.6.0, 2.6.1, and 2.6.2
* Support for patching of service accounts and configuring their labels and annotations. The feature is disabled by default and enabled using the new `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gate.
* Added support for configuring cluster-operator's worker thread pool size that is used for various sync and async tasks
* Add Kafka Quotas plugin with produce, consume, and storage quotas
* Support pausing reconciliation of KafkaTopic CR with annotation `strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation`
* Update cruise control to 2.5.57

* Add support for selectively changing the verbosity of logging for individual CRs, using markers.
* Added support for `controller_mutation_rate' quota. Creation/Deletion of topics and creation of partitions can be configured through this.
* Use newer version of Kafka Exporter with different bugfixes 

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The deprecated `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource will be removed after the 0.24.0 release. 
  Please use the [migration guide](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#proc-migrating-kafka-connect-s2i-str) to migrate your `KafkaConnectS2I` deployments to [`KafkaConnect` Build](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* The fields `topicsBlacklistPattern` and `groupsBlacklistPattern` in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  They are replaced by new fields `topicsExcludePattern` and `groupsExcludePattern`.
* The field `whitelist` in the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  It is replaced with a new field `include`.
* `bind-utils` removed from containers to improve security posture.
* Kafka Connect Build now uses hashes to name downloaded artifact files. Previously, it was using the last segment of the download URL.
  If your artifact requires a specific name, you can use the new `type: other` artifact and its `fileName` field.
* The option `enableECDSA` of Kafka CR `authentication` of type `oauth` has been deprecated and is ignored. 
  ECDSA token signature support is now always enabled without the need for Strimzi Cluster Operator installing the BouncyCastle JCE crypto provider. 
  BouncyCastle library is no longer packaged with Strimzi Kafka images.

* Support for configuring custom Authorizer implementation 
* Changed Reconciliation interval for Topic Operator from 90 to 120 seconds (to keep it the same as for other operators)
* Changed Zookeeper session timeout default value to 18 seconds for Topic and User Operators (for improved resiliency)
* Removed requirement for replicas and partitions KafkaTopic spec making these parameters optional
* Support to configure a custom filter for parent CR's labels propagation into subresources

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Strimzi API versions `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` were removed from all Strimzi custom resources apart from `KafkaTopic` and `KafkaUser` (use `v1beta2` versions instead)
* The following annotations have been removed and cannot be used anymore:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)
* When the `class` field is configured in the `configuration` section of an Ingress-type listener, Strimzi will not automatically set the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation anymore. In case you still need this annotation, you can set it manually in the listener configuration using the [`annotations` field](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#property-listener-config-annotations-reference) or in the [`.spec.kafka.template` section](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#type-KafkaClusterTemplate-reference).
* The `.spec.kafkaExporter.template.service` section in the `Kafka` custom resource has been deprecated and will be removed in the next API version (the service itself was removed several releases ago).

## 0.22.0

* Add `v1beta2` version for all resources. `v1beta2` removes all deprecated fields.
* Add annotations that enable the operator to restart Kafka Connect connectors or tasks. The annotations can be applied to the KafkaConnector and the KafkaMirrorMaker2 custom resources.

* Add support for Ingress v1 in Kubernetes 1.19 and newer
* Add support for Kafka 2.6.1
* List topics used by a Kafka Connect connector in the `.status` section of the `KafkaConnector` custom resource
* Bump Cruise Control to v2.5.37 for Kafka 2.7 support. Note this new version of Cruise Control uses `Log4j 2` and is supported by dynamic logging configuration (where logging properties are defined in a ConfigMap). However, existing `Log4j` configurations must be updated to `Log4j 2` configurations.
* Support pausing reconciliation of CR with annotation `strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation`

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* In the past, when no Ingress class was specified in the Ingress-type listener in the Kafka custom resource, the 
  `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation was automatically set to `nginx`. Because of the support for the new 
  IngressClass resource and the new `ingressClassName` field in the Ingress resource, the default value will not be set 
  anymore. Please use the `class` field in `.spec.kafka.listeners[].configuration` to specify the class name.
* The `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource is deprecated and will be removed in the future. You can use the new [`KafkaConnect` build feature](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* Removed support for Helm2 charts as that version is now unsupported. There is no longer the need for separate `helm2` and `helm3` binaries, only `helm` (version 3) is required.
* The following annotations are deprecated for a long time and will be removed in 0.23.0:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)
* External logging configuration has changed. `spec.logging.name` is deprecated. Moved to `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.name`. Key in the `ConfigMap` is configurable via `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.key`.
  * from
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    name: my-config-map
  ```
  * to
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config-map
        key: my-key
  ``` 
* Existing Cruise Control logging configurations must be updated from `Log4j` syntax to `Log4j 2` syntax.
  * For existing inline configurations, replace the `cruisecontrol.root.logger` property with `rootLogger.level`.
  * For existing external configurations, replace the existing configuration with a new configuration file named `log4j2.properties` using `log4j 2` syntax.

## 0.21.0

* Add support for Kafka 2.7.0

### Deprecations and removals
* The `metrics` field in the Strimzi custom resources has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. For configuring metrics, use the new `metricsConfig` field and pass the configuration via ConfigMap.

## 0.20.0

**Note: This is the last version of Strimzi that will support Kubernetes 1.11 and higher. Future versions will drop support for Kubernetes 1.11-1.15 and support only Kubernetes 1.16 and higher.**

* Add support for Kafka 2.5.1 and 2.6.0. Remove support for 2.4.0 and 2.4.1
* Remove TLS sidecars from Kafka pods => Kafka now uses native TLS to connect to ZooKeeper
* Updated to Cruise Control 2.5.11, which adds Kafka 2.6.0 support and fixes a previous issue with CPU utilization statistics for containers. As a result, the CpuCapacityGoal has now been enabled.

  * Support for re-authentication was added, which also enforces access token lifespan on the Kafka client session
  * Permission changes through Keycloak Authorization Services are now detected by Kafka Brokers

### Deprecations and removals

#### Redesign of the `.spec.kafka.listeners` section

The `.spec.kafka.listeners` section of the Kafka CRD has been redesigned to allow configuring more different listeners.
The old `listeners` object which allowed only configuration of one`plain`, one `tls`, and one `external` listener is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
It is replaced with an array allowing configuration of multiple different listeners:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: local
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external1
    port: 9093
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
  - name: external2
    port: 9094
    type: nodeport
    tls: true
```

This change includes some other changes:
* The `tls` field is now required.
* The former `overrides` section is now merged with the `configuration` section.
* The `dnsAnnotations` field has been renamed to `annotations` since we found out it has wider use.
* Configuration of `loadBalancerSourceRanges` and `externalTrafficPolicy` has been moved into listener configuration. Its use in the `template` section is now deprecated.
* For `type: internal` listeners, you can now use the flag `useServiceDnsDomain` to define whether they should use the fully qualified DNS names including the cluster service suffix (usually `.cluster.local`). This option defaults to false.
* All listeners now support configuring the advertised hostname and port.
* `preferredAddressType` has been removed to `preferredNodePortAddressType`.

To convert the old format into the new format with backwards compatibility, you should use following names and types:
* For the old `plain` listener, use the name `plain`, port `9092` and type `internal`.
* For the old `tls` listener, use the name `tls`, port `9093` and type `internal`.
* For the old `external` listener, use the name `external`, port `9094`.

For example the following old configuration:

```yaml
listeners:
  plain:
    # ...
  tls: 
    # ...
  external:
    type: loadbalancer 
    # ...
```

Will look like this in the new format:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: plain
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: false
  - name: tls
    port: 9093
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external
    port: 9094
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
```

#### Removal of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we have removed the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
It was already deprecated in the previous 0.19.0 release.
Together with it we have also removed the Prometheus annotations from the services. If you want to add them, you can use the templates.
See here https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/using.html#assembly-customizing-kubernetes-resources-str for more details about templates usage.
Finally, the Kafka Exporter service was has been removed because it was used just for the monitoring port.

#### Deprecation of Kafka TLS sidecar configuration

Since the Kafka TLS sidecar has been removed, the related configuration options in the Kafka custom resource are now deprecated:
* `.spec.kafka.tlsSidecar`
* `.spec.kafka.template.tlsSidecar`

## 0.19.0

* Add support for authorization using Open Policy Agent
* Add support for scale subresource to make scaling of following resources easier:
  * KafkaConnect
  * KafkaConnectS2I
  * KafkaBridge
  * KafkaMirrorMaker
  * KafkaMirrorMaker2
  * KafkaConnector 
* Remove deprecated `Kafka.spec.topicOperator` classes and deployment logic
* Use Java 11 as the Java runtime
* Removed the need to manually create Cruise Control metrics topics if topic auto creation is disabled.
* Migration to Helm 3
* Refactored the format of the `KafkaRebalance` resource's status. The state of the rebalance is now displayed in the associated `Condition`'s `type` field rather than the `status` field. This was done so that the information would display correctly in various Kubernetes tools.
* Added performance tuning options to the `KafkaRebalance` CR and the ability to define a regular expression that will exclude matching topics from a rebalance optimization proposal.
* Use Strimzi Kafka Bridge 0.18.0
* Make it possible to configure labels and annotations for secrets created by the User Operator
* Strimzi Kafka Bridge metrics integration:
  * enable/disable metrics in the KafkaBridge custom resource
  * new Grafana dashboard for the bridge metrics
* Support dynamically changeable logging in the Entity Operator and Kafka Bridge 
* Extended the Grafana example dashboard for Kafka Connect to provide more relevant information

### Deprecations and removals

#### Deprecation of Helm v2 chart

The Helm v2 support will end soon. 
Bug fixing should stop on August 13th 2020 and security fixes on November 13th.
See https://helm.sh/blog/covid-19-extending-helm-v2-bug-fixes/ for more details.

In sync with that, the Helm v2 chart of Strimzi Cluster Operator is now deprecated and will be removed in the future as Helm v2 support ends.
Since Strimzi 0.19.0, we have a new chart for Helm v3 which can be used instead.

#### Removal of v1alpha1 versions of several custom resources

In Strimzi 0.12.0, the `v1alpha1` versions of the following resources have been deprecated and replaced by `v1beta1`:
* `Kafka`
* `KafkaConnect`
* `KafkaConnectS2I`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker`
* `KafkaTopic`
* `KafkaUser`

In the next release, the `v1alpha1` versions of these resources will be removed. 
Please follow the guide for upgrading the resources: https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#assembly-upgrade-resources-str.

#### Removal deprecated cadvisor metric labels

The `pod_name` and `container_name` labels provided on the cadvisor metrics are now just `pod` and `container` starting from Kubernetes 1.16.
We removed the old ones from the Prometheus scraping configuration/alerts and on the Kafka and ZooKeeper dashboard as well.
It means that the charts related to memory and CPU usage are not going to work on Kuvbernetes version previous 1.14.
For more information on what is changed: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3312

#### Deprecation of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we are deprecating the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
This port will be removed in the next release.
Together with it we will also remove the Prometheus annotation from the service.

#### Removal warning of Cluster Operator log level

Because of the new Cluster Operator dynamic logging configuration via [PR#3328](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3328) we are going to remove the `STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable from the Cluster Operator deployment YAML file in the 0.20.0 release.
